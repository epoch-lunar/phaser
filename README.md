# phaser
A timing library for cislunar applications.

`phaser` provides the building blocks for working with time across Earth and lunar reference frames: converting between time scales, modeling clock behavior during GPS outages, and computing the relativistic corrections that keep lunar systems synchronized.

Designed to run anywhere from ground stations to flight hardware.
